Customer View

Bamazon is a mock online marketplace built with mySQL, Javascript, and Nodejs. It also incorporates the Inquirer.js Node module for the customer interaction. 

Key functionalities:

- Receiving inventory data from mySQL database, and presenting the user with the inventory in a readable manner. 
- Asking the customer if they would like to make a purchase, and guiding the user through a series of prompts. 
- Checking the user's inputs to make sure they are valid within the parameters of the program's functionality, and returning a message if they are not. 
- Returning a message if the user quantity desired is more than the inventory of the item in the database. 
- Updating the SQL database with customer purchase and reducing the available inventory by that amount. 
- Displaying the price the user owes for their purchase. 
- Once the purchase is complete, presenting the customer the chance to choose another item to purchase, starting the process over again. 
- If the user chooses not to continue with another purchase bu clikcing on "Exit", they will receive a goodbye message.
